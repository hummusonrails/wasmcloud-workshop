Welcome to the wasmCloud Distributed Architecture Workshop! In this session, you'll learn how to design, build, and deploy a distributed system using wasmCloud’s actor-based model, with a focus on scaling across cloud and edge environments.

This workshop introduces you to wasmCloud, a platform designed for building highly distributed, scalable applications. You will gain insights into how to:

✅ Design a multi-actor architecture to handle distributed workloads.
✅ Deploy actors and capabilities across different environments efficiently.
✅ Integrate external services, such as Couchbase, into a wasmCloud system.
✅ Scale dynamically across both cloud and edge devices.

During this workshop, you will:

1. Deploy a modular system using wasmCloud actors.
2. Integrate Couchbase using wasmCloud’s capability provider model.
3. Run your own edge node inside a GitHub Codespace, connecting to a shared cloud wasmCloud instance.
4. Scale your applications dynamically across multiple hosts and environments.
